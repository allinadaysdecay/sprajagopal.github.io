title: about the decent singularity
---
<p>The world is a mess. Always has been, always will be. Are we gonna fix it? We can't. What we do is, we take all this chaos and work to make sense of this.</p>
<p> Which is a lost cause. </p>
<p> There is no sense in it and you know it.</p>
<p> But then, it's interesting that the more closer you get to answers, the more challenges you face. Zeno's paradox, eh?</p>
<p> But the chase... it's adrenaline. The possibility. The answers - so close.</p>
<p> So I do science. I do science because there is nothing else that gets me high as it does.</p>
