	Epiphanies during Evolutionary Computing lectures

  The very subject of optimization and the various methods in it is intriguing and enough to keep one absorbed for days. Evolutionary computing is my elective this semester and I am impressed. I have only barely started but I'm already hooked like a junkie on weed.

	Displaying matlab contribution in Google Sites
      </a>
      <div class="postbody">
	<p>Many professors and students use google sites for their academic site. It might be required to display your mathworks profile in your google site. The older method to embed another webpage was to simply use the IFrame gadget from the Insert menu. Currently, the iframe elements do not work in the google sites as a security measure. So I was googling around to find a way to show my mathworks contribution in my google site. I couldn't find any.</p>
