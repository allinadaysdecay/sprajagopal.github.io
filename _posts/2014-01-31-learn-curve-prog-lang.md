title: The learning curve for a programming language
---
<p>
I've always prided myself in being fluid when it comes to programming languages. I've had friends tell me I should have been studying computer science instead of mechanical engineering (considering that they wanted programming favours from me, their words are probably not very reliable).
</p>

<p>
But I'll admit this. I'm a hack. I'm quick, sure, but I only get the essentials and hack away to make it work. Whatever it is.</p>

<p>
I have found that engineering students usually shun away from programming unless it becomes absolutely necessary. I have seen course drops just because they involve assignments to be done in MATLAB or C or something similar.</p>

<p>
Learning a programming language is easy <i>if</i> you are comfortable with algorithms and math. A programming language is simply a tool that makes your idea readily computable by a suitable computer.</p>

<p> 
It is evident then, that the programming part is simply a final step to check our idea and play around with it. Of course, if your research itself is on algorithms, then it is a different thing entirely. I'm talking about researchers working on a core branch and need their ideas validated quickly. </p>

<p> 
Once the algorithm or mathematical model is ready and has passed the manual check, involving convergence checks and boundary cases and what not, you are now ready to take it to the big platform. </p>

<p>
I'm going on and on about how easy it is but I can sense your wariness. I'm not a big talker. Okay, a little bit. Mostly, I am as good as my talk. If I had to convince you, I'll say that, I've used MATLAB, Python and C++ for a variety of research purposes. I'm a mechanical engineer and I haven't had classes in any of these languages. I'm simply trying to convince you that classes are not necessary to hack your way <i>efficiently</i> through a small part of your research project. </p>

<p>
Go on. Look through my MathWorks page before you come back to this post. </p>

<p> Alright, now that you are convinced (if you are), let's get back to learning languages. </p>

<p> 
Three things that are highly essential during the initial days of a new programming language:</p>

<ul>
<li> A working internet connection (low speed, high speed, anything works) </li>
<li> A familiar text editor </li>
<li> Lots and lots of coffee </li>
</ul>

<p>
The last one is not completely necessary but it definitely doesn't hurt. </p>

<p> 
First things first, install the necessary compiler in your computer. All major languages are compatible with all kinds of OSes. Make sure to check this and find any alternative languages if you find any troubles of compatibility. </p>

<p>
I recommend working completely on the command line and for this reason, I find Linux a very pleasing platform for all programming (read amateur hacking) pursuits. The reason a command line is better is that it gives you complete control and sight over what's happening. A GUI obscures most of the things and you end up becoming dependent on it. It's always better to have the ability to work with whatever bare minimum you have.</p>

<p>
Create a Dropbox folder, initialize a git, whatever makes you feel safe about your work. </p>

<p>
Now, start writing a "hello world" program. Search through the internet, find a basic tutorial, skim over the details about variable types, file extensions and get to the core. They're all blah, blah, same old, same old. </p>

<p>
The basic tutorials usually deal with printing out data to the stdout and storing variables. They also cover the arithmetic calculations part, if that's possible. </p>
